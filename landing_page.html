        Different Modes of AAEU 
      </p>
      <p class="text-center text-justify">
        1. <span class="font-bold">Tracker:</span> for specific health conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Currently, those two are only available health conditions, but we can definitely expend on it. For diabetes, the program will track time for insulin injection and remind patients. For high blood pressure, it will track loud and hard yelling or high heart beat (if we can connect a watch to the application) and advise the patient to calm down. If allowed, the program will play calming music to relax the patient.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center text-justify">
        2. <span class="font-bold">Critical:</span> for people who have critical health conditions and are at risk of emergency at any time when left alone. This mode will allow users to set up a secret word(s) to say when they need 911 called immediately, but are not able to directly call the responders. The program will be constantly listening for the secret word they set up, and when the program hears the secret word, it will call 911 to the patient's location. This mode will constantly be alert for emergency distress phrases, even the slightest ones.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center text-justify">
        3. <span class="font-bold">Non-critical:</span> for users with little to no critical health condition. Listens for emergency commands like the critical mode, but the program is in less alert. Users can also set up a different command for emergencies like kidnap and domestic violence. When the program hears the secret command, the program will alert 911 and start recording the surrounding in order to allow the responders to know the situation in the surrounding. Using Symbl.ai API, the program will detect keywords like "weapon", "gun", and "shoot" to allow the first responders to be prepared. This will allow more effective rescuing.
